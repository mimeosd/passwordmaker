# passwordmaker
Ever wanted to create account at some website and you keep getting stuck at password field?
Well worry no more.
With help of Angela Yu (big shout to this woman!) I share Password maker.
1. Input website you are making a pass for (so you can search password later on)
2. Change email to the one you are using for your site.
3. Click "Generate password". It will make you a random password and automaticaly copy it to clipboard.
4. For additional convenience, click "Add" to save it to JSON file (that will be made in your directory).
And that is it. Later on if you need to search for your password - simply type name of website you entered and that is it.
Hope you find it convenient!
